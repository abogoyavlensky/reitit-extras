Additional utilities for the Reitit router.

## Overview

A collection of practical utilities and middleware extensions for the Reitit router, including:

- Context injection middleware for system dependencies
- Development-mode handler reloading
- Resource handlers with configurable caching
- HTML rendering utilities with Hiccup integration
- Comprehensive exception handling middleware
- Testing utilities for HTTP servers

## Development

### Requirements
Install Java, Clojure and Babashka manually or via [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/):

```shell
mise install
```

*Note: Check versions in `.mise.toml` file.*

### Manage project

All management tasks:

```shell
bb tasks
The following tasks are available:

deps            Install all deps
fmt-check       Check code formatting
fmt             Fix code formatting
lint-init       Import linting configs
lint            Linting project's code
test            Run tests
outdated-check  Check outdated Clojure deps versions
outdated        Upgrade outdated Clojure deps versions
check           Run all code checks and tests
deploy-snapshot Deploy snapshot version to Clojars
deploy-release  Deploy release version to Clojars
release         Create and push git tag for release
```

## Build and publish

### Install locally

```shell
bb install
```

### Deploy to Clojars from local machine

**Note:** Publishing to Clojars requires `CLOJARS_USERNAME` and `CLOJARS_PASSWORD` environment variables.

Deploy snapshost version:

```shell
bb deploy-snapshot
```

Deploy release version:

```shell
bb deploy-release
```

### Deploy to Clojars from Github Actions

Set up following secrets for Actions:

- `CLOJARS_USERNAME`
- `CLOJARS_PASSWORD`

Then you will be able to push to master branch to deploy snapshot version automatically.

Once you decide to publish release you just need to bump version at deps.edn:

`:aliases -> :build -> :exec-args -> :version -> "0.1.1`

and create a git tag with this version. There is a shortcut command for this:

```shell
bb release
```

This command will create a git tag with the latest version from deps.edn and push it to git repository.
Github Actions will automatically deploy a release version to Clojars.
